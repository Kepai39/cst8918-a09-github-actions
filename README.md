# Hybrid-A09 Husky and GitHub Actions


## Issues I Have Encountered:
I had issues with the workflow as the terraform was validating the syntax although the syntax was wrong.  To improve and test error I added the action to activate on push: -main.  The issue was solved by using dflook/terraform-validate@v1 as I needed to validate within the correct folder (infrastructure).  The false positive was caused because it was validating files in the incorrect folder.

## Succesfull screenshot Results:
